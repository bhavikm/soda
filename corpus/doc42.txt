US house prices show strong gains
US house prices are continuing to show strong growth according to a closely watched survey.
The S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index showed that prices rose 12.4% over the 12 months to the end of July.
The index measures single-family home prices across 20 cities, with 13 cities showing a rising annual growth rate.
Last week, the US Federal Reserve decided to maintain its effort to boost the economy, which involves buying $85bn worth of assets every month.
That scheme, known as quantitative easing (QE), is credited with boosting the housing market last year by driving down mortgage rates to record lows.
However, David Blitzer from S&P Dow Jones Indices said that effect has worn off.
"Following the increase in mortgage rates beginning last May, applications for mortgages have dropped, suggesting that rising interest rates are affecting housing.
"The Fed's announcement last week that QE3 bond buying will continue for the time being may have only a limited, though favourable, impact on housing." he said.
Las Vegas saw the biggest annual gain of 27.5%, while San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego all saw gains of more than 20%.
But the survey points out that house prices in those cities are still well below the peaks hit before the 2008 financial crisis.
Of the 20 cities surveyed, New York saw the lowest annual increase of 3.5%.
Detroit, which filed for bankruptcy in July, saw an annual growth rate of 16.9%. However, the report says that Detroit is the only city where house prices are still below the levels reached in January 2000.
